/**
Summary: Message sent when you should resize the row group to fit the viewable area.

Parameters:
pControlRect: The rect that the row control should fill.

Description:
Typically you will only use `item 3 of pControlRect` to adjust the right
side of any controls to fill the available width.

If the `viewProps["fixed row height"]` of the DataView is `false` then
you will most likely be adjusting the height of the controls in the row.

Returns: nothing
